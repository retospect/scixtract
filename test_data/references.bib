  abstract	= {Abstract Designing electrocatalysts with optimal activity
		  and selectivity relies on a thorough understanding of the
		  surface structure under reaction conditions. In this study,
		  experimental and computational approaches are combined to
		  elucidate reconstruction processes on low-index Pd surfaces
		  during H-insertion following proton electroreduction. While
		  electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy clearly
		  reveals pronounced surface roughening and morphological
		  changes on Pd(111), Pd(110), and Pd(100) surfaces during
		  cyclic voltammetry, a complementary analysis using
		  inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry excludes Pd
		  dissolution as the primary cause of the observed
		  restructuring. Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations
		  further show that these surface alterations are related to
		  the creation and propagation of structural defects as well
		  as phase transformations that take place during hydride
		  formation.},
